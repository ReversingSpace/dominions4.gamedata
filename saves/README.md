# Save data

This was done in a bit of a hurry.  I haven't actually had the time to play a real game of Dom4 in a while, so a lot of this is coloured by Dom3 memories, more than Dom4.  As a result some of the names might be off, but the aim here is to get the structure first, and to worry about names later.

Consider this release the 0.0.x line.  It won't be versioned until the API is cleaned, which will happen for a fully described fatherland file in 0.1.x.
